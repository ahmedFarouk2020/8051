* Don't use .c files just use headers if you want
* makefile is used to compile project and generate .hex file "change the path and files name to compile without errors". this solution is made sothat you can build your project in VScode.
* If you have errors compile each c file separately by using "path_to/SiLabs/MCU/IDEfiles/C51/BIN/C51.exe file_name.C" then use "make" command.
